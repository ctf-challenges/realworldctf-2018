The spectre's paper told me that the vulnerability can only be used to achieve information discloure, while I don't care about infoleak. Why not use it to exchange superior performance?

Hint: If you are not a master of Spectre, maybe you can use some unpatched 1day bug.

Hint 2: The spectre's patch happens to make certain bugs unable to be triggered. Hence Microsoft is lazy, so they may not even analyze or patch those bugs. Try to retrieve some unpatched 1 day bugs please.Also I found a [tweet][1] which may be related to this.
