Hey dud, tell you what, I was learning Solidity and has created a wallet contract for myself to help me manage my HUGE amount of valuable tokens! I've double checked the code, it's handy and secure, nice and cool, I just love it! I'm pretty confident about the fact that no one could ever stolen my token through the wallet, NO ONE!!! You don't believe it? Try it! Hhhhhhhhh...

- Your team needs to solve AT LEAST 5 other challenges to start this one.
- Send a POST request to http://18.211.57.236:8080/fire to init this challenge, including your team name and team token in the following format. curl -X POST -F "name=team1" -F "token=mx4K4zVZQmOp6oh3j8jxCg==" http://18.211.57.236:8080/fire
- deploy.js, genesis.json, test account privatekey and the contract source code are provided FYI.
- It could take about 10-20 seconds for the flag to be delievered after you solved it.
- If the RPC fails, contact the admin only after you've retried many times.
